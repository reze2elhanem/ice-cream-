      You wake up in a pink world. The clouds are whipped cream. The rivers? Strawberry milk. The grass giggles when you step on it.  
      Something’s not right... everything is too sweet. Suspiciously sweet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, a strawberry (with eyes and sneakers) runs past you screaming, “THE SPOON IS COMING!”  
      You chase it through the Jellybean Jungle, across the Marshmallow Mountains, until you find... a Mirror.
    </p>

    <p>
      You look. It’s you.  
      YOU are the Spoon.  
      You’ve been the Spoon all along.
    </p>

    <p>
      You sit. You cry strawberry syrup. You eat a flower. It tastes like bubblegum.  
      You accept your destiny: to scoop joy wherever you go.
    </p>

    <p><em>Congratulations, sweet warrior. You’ve unlocked the Strawberry Madness.</em></p>
