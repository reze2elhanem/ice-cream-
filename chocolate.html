    <h1>🍫 The Chocolate Expedition</h1>


    <p>
      Once upon a snack time...  
      You, yes YOU, bravely set out on a dangerous mission: to find the legendary <strong>Chocolate Scoop of Eternal Joy</strong>. Armed with nothing but a spoon and an unreasonable love for desserts, you trekked through the dark, fudgy Forest of Cocoa.
    </p>

    <p>
      The path was sticky. The trees? Made of brownies. The birds? They chirped like, “CHIP! CHIP!” because they were chocolate chips.  
      You almost turned back when your foot got stuck in a molten lava cake—but you pushed through. Hero stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, on top of Mt. ChocoMore, you saw it. A swirl so smooth, so shiny, it made Nutella jealous. You took a bite. The world paused. Angels sang. Your soul did a backflip.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that’s the story of how you, brave dessert explorer, earned your Chocolate Badge of Deliciousness.  
      Please, wear it proudly (and maybe grab a napkin).
    </p>

    <p><em>Note: No spoons were harmed in this expedition. But one did cry from joy.</em></p>
