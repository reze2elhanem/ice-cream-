    <h1>🍋 Welcome to The Sour Side</h1>


    <p>
      You were warned. The path of Lemon is not for the weak-tongued.  
      The moment you stepped into Sourville, your face twisted like origami.
    </p>

    <p>
      The trees squirt lemon juice. The clouds? Lemon zest. The ground?  
      Literally made of sour candy belts. It's sticky. It's citrusy. It's chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
      You meet the Lemon Council — a group of wise, bitter lemons in tiny robes.  
      They speak only in zesty riddles like, “When life peels you, squirt back.”  
      You nod. You pretend to understand. You don’t. But you respect the vibes.
    </p>

    <p>
      One lemon hands you a golden spoon. You don’t ask why. You just scoop.  
      And in that moment, your tastebuds awaken. Your eyes widen.  
      You’re not afraid anymore.
    </p>

    <p><em>You're now one of them. A Zesty One. Welcome to the squad.</em></p>


    <blockquote>
      "When life gives you lemons… yeah, we already know. Just eat the damn scoop."
